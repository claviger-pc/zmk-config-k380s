 Board config for Pebble Keys 2 k380s

This is a work in progress board configuration for building ZMK for a Pebble Keys 2 - k380s. Unlike the original k380 which had an old Bluetooth 3.0 chip, this revision has a Nordic nrf52832. The revision of the chip is QFAB, which means only 256kb of storage and 32kb of ram. Without usb support, the k380s will need to be manually flashed, although the debugging pins are easily broken out for access. Other challenges will include the complex matrix employed by the board. Some work on the matrix [has already been done by Tyalie](https://github.com/tyalie/TyK380-keyboard).
